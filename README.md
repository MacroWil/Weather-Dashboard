# Weather-Dashboard

This is the sixth challenge in the DU Coding Bootcamp. Being an even number assignment, all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code was written from scratch. The application is a weather dashboard. The user enters a city/town, state/country anywere, and the weather today as well as a 5-day forecast is displayed. After the user searches for a destination, their previous search is saved and displayed below the search bar. Four collaborators contributed to the project, Bryn Glotfelty, Patrick Mulville, Maguire Wilson, and Zachary Short. The java script utilizes two API's to convert the location to longitude and latitude, and fetch the weather given said latitude and longitude. The appearance of the site utilizes bootstrap and was further touched up using traditional CSS.
